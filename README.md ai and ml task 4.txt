# AI & ML Internship – Task 4
## Feature Encoding & Scaling

## Objective
To preprocess data by encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features for machine learning models.

## Dataset
Adult Income Dataset

## Steps Performed
- Identified categorical and numerical features
- Applied Label Encoding to target variable
- Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical features
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
- Saved the processed dataset

## Importance
Encoding converts text to numbers, and scaling ensures fair contribution of features in ML algorithms.

## Conclusion
Feature encoding and scaling improve model performance and are essential steps in feature engineering.
